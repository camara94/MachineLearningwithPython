Hello, and welcome!

1
00:00:02,730 --> 00:00:07,299
In this video, we’ll be covering accuracy metrics for model evaluation.

2
00:00:07,299 --> 00:00:10,810
So, let’s get started.

3
00:00:10,810 --> 00:00:14,620
Evaluation metrics are used to explain the performance of a model.

4
00:00:14,620 --> 00:00:19,860
Let’s talk more about the model evaluation metrics that are used for regression.

5
00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:26,320
As mentioned, basically, we can compare the actual values and predicted values to calculate

6
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:29,970
the accuracy of a regression model.

7
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:35,230
Evaluation metrics provide a key role in the development of a model, as it provides insight

8
00:00:35,230 --> 00:00:37,820
to areas that require improvement.

9
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:42,579
We’ll be reviewing a number of model evaluation metrics, including:

10
00:00:42,579 --> 00:00:48,469
Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).

11
00:00:48,469 --> 00:00:55,129
But, before we get into defining these, we need to define what an error actually is.

12
00:00:55,129 --> 00:01:00,170
In the context of regression, the error of the model is the difference between the data

13
00:01:00,170 --> 00:01:04,449
points and the trend line generated by the algorithm.

14
00:01:04,449 --> 00:01:10,470
Since there are multiple data points, an error can be determined in multiple ways.

15
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:15,770
Mean absolute error is the mean of the absolute value of the errors.

16
00:01:15,770 --> 00:01:21,600
This is the easiest of the metrics to understand, since it’s just the average error.

17
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:25,250
Mean Squared Error (MSE) is the mean of the squared error.

18
00:01:25,250 --> 00:01:31,979
It’s more popular than Mean absolute error because the focus is geared more towards large

19
00:01:31,979 --> 00:01:33,200
errors.

20
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:38,619
This is due to the squared term exponentially increasing larger errors in comparison to

21
00:01:38,619 --> 00:01:40,539
smaller ones.

22
00:01:40,539 --> 00:01:43,050
Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) is the square

23
00:01:43,050 --> 00:01:46,270
root of the mean squared error.

24
00:01:46,270 --> 00:01:52,159
This is one of the most popular of the evaluation metrics because Root Mean Squared Error is

25
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:59,310
interpretable in the same units as the response vector (or ‘y’ units) making it easy to relate

26
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:01,409
its information.

27
00:02:01,409 --> 00:02:08,560
Relative Absolute Error (RAE), also known as Residual sum of square, where y-bar is a mean value

28
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:16,409
of y, takes the total absolute error and normalizes it by dividing by the total absolute error

29
00:02:16,409 --> 00:02:18,920
of the simple predictor.

30
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:24,310
Relative Squared Error (RSE) is very similar to “Relative absolute error “, but is widely

31
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:30,489
adopted by the data science community, as it is used for calculating R-squared.

32
00:02:30,489 --> 00:02:37,219
R-squared is not error, per se, but is a popular metric for the accuracy of your model.

33
00:02:37,219 --> 00:02:42,909
It represents how close the data values are to the fitted regression line.

34
00:02:42,909 --> 00:02:47,900
The higher the R-squared, the better the model fits your data.

35
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:52,250
Each of these metrics can be used for quantifying of your prediction.

36
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:58,359
The choice of metric completely depends on the type of model, your data type, and domain

37
00:02:58,359 --> 00:02:59,879
of knowledge.

38
00:02:59,879 --> 00:03:04,499
Unfortunately, further review is out of scope of this course.

39
00:03:04,499 --> 00:03:05,589
Thanks for watching!
