Hello, and welcome!

1
00:00:02,389 --> 00:00:05,860
In this video, we’ll be giving a brief introduction to regression.

2
00:00:05,860 --> 00:00:08,189
So let’s get started.

3
00:00:08,189 --> 00:00:10,019
Look at this dataset.

4
00:00:10,019 --> 00:00:13,499
It&#39;s related to Co2 emissions from different cars.

5
00:00:13,499 --> 00:00:20,020
It includes Engine size, number of Cylinders, Fuel Consumption and Co2 emission from various

6
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:22,240
automobile models.

7
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:28,820
The question is, &quot;Given this dataset, can we predict the Co2 emission of a car using

8
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:32,560
other fields, such as EngineSize or Cylinders?&quot;

9
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:38,350
Let’s assume we have some historical data from different cars, and assume that a car,

10
00:00:38,350 --> 00:00:43,789
such as in row 9, has not been manufactured yet, but we&#39;re interested in estimating its

11
00:00:43,789 --> 00:00:47,879
approximate Co2 emission, after production.

12
00:00:47,879 --> 00:00:49,760
Is it possible?

13
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:56,010
We can use regression methods to predict a continuous value, such as CO2 Emission, using

14
00:00:56,010 --> 00:00:58,200
some other variables.

15
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:03,889
Indeed, regression is the process of predicting a continuous value.

16
00:01:03,889 --> 00:01:11,040
In regression there are two types of variables: a dependent variable and one or more independent

17
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:12,230
variables.

18
00:01:12,230 --> 00:01:17,690
The dependent variable can be seen as the &quot;state&quot;, &quot;target&quot; or &quot;final goal&quot; we study

19
00:01:17,690 --> 00:01:24,640
and try to predict, and the independent variables, also known as explanatory variables, can be

20
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:27,620
seen as the &quot;causes&quot; of those &quot;states&quot;.

21
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:34,720
The independent variables are shown conventionally by x; and the dependent variable is notated

22
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:35,720
by y.

23
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:44,350
A regression model relates y, or the dependent variable, to a function of x, i.e., the independent

24
00:01:44,350 --> 00:01:45,540
variables.

25
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:50,281
The key point in the regression is that our dependent value should be continuous, and

26
00:01:50,281 --> 00:01:53,000
cannot be a discreet value.

27
00:01:53,000 --> 00:02:00,920
However, the independent variable or variables can be measured on either a categorical or

28
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:03,650
continuous measurement scale.

29
00:02:03,650 --> 00:02:09,750
So, what we want to do here is to use the historical data of some cars, using one or

30
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:14,920
more of their features, and from that data, make a model.

31
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:19,890
We use regression to build such a regression/estimation model.

32
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:27,160
Then the model is used to predict the expected Co2 emission for a new or unknown car.

33
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:34,010
Basically there are 2 types of regression models: simple regression and multiple regression.

34
00:02:34,010 --> 00:02:39,970
Simple regression is when one independent variable is used to estimate a dependent variable.

35
00:02:39,970 --> 00:02:43,400
It can be either linear on non-linear.

36
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:49,250
For example, predicting Co2emission using the variable of EngineSize.

37
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:55,700
Linearity of regression is based on the nature of relationship between independent and dependent

38
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:56,840
variables.

39
00:02:56,840 --> 00:03:02,250
When more than one independent variable is present, the process is called multiple linear

40
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:03,420
regression.

41
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:09,650
For example, predicting Co2emission using EngineSize and the number of Cylinders in

42
00:03:09,650 --> 00:03:11,590
any given car.

43
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:17,740
Again, depending on the relation between dependent and independent variables, it can be either

44
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:20,700
linear or non-linear regression.

45
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:25,010
Let’s examine some sample applications of regression.

46
00:03:25,010 --> 00:03:31,040
Essentially, we use regression when we want to estimate a continuous value.

47
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:38,300
For instance, one of the applications of regression analysis could be in the area of sales forecasting.

48
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:43,800
You can try to predict a salesperson&#39;s total yearly sales from independent variables such

49
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:48,300
as age, education, and years of experience.

50
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:54,260
It can also be used in the field of psychology, for example, to determine individual satisfaction

51
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:58,080
based on demographic and psychological factors.

52
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:03,130
We can use regression analysis to predict the price of a house in an area, based on its

53
00:04:03,130 --> 00:04:06,580
size, number of bedrooms, and so on.

54
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:12,700
We can even use it to predict employment income for independent variables, such as hours of

55
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:20,150
work, education, occupation, sex, age, years of experience, and so on.

56
00:04:20,149 --> 00:04:25,840
Indeed, you can find many examples of the usefulness of regression analysis in these

57
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:32,770
and many other fields or domains, such as finance, healthcare, retail, and more.

58
00:04:32,770 --> 00:04:35,460
We have many regression algorithms.

59
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:40,490
Each of them has its own importance and a specific condition to which their application

60
00:04:40,490 --> 00:04:42,240
is best suited.

61
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:46,940
And while we&#39;ve covered just a few of them in this course, it gives you enough base knowledge

62
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:50,520
for you to explore different regression techniques.

63
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:51,020
Thanks for watching!
