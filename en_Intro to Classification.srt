Hello!

1
00:00:01,420 --> 00:00:04,970
In this video, we’ll give you an introduction to Classification.

2
00:00:04,970 --> 00:00:06,830
So let’s get started.

3
00:00:06,830 --> 00:00:12,660
In Machine Learning, classification is a supervised learning approach, which can be thought of

4
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:18,860
as a means of categorizing or &quot;classifying&quot; some unknown items into a discrete set of

5
00:00:18,860 --> 00:00:20,790
&quot;classes.&quot;

6
00:00:20,790 --> 00:00:25,750
Classification attempts to learn the relationship between a set of feature variables and a target

7
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:27,830
variable of interest.

8
00:00:27,830 --> 00:00:34,039
The target attribute in classification is a categorical variable with discrete values.

9
00:00:34,039 --> 00:00:39,109
So, how does classification and classifiers work?

10
00:00:39,109 --> 00:00:44,399
Given a set of training data points, along with the target labels, classification determines

11
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:47,739
the class label for an unlabeled test case.

12
00:00:47,739 --> 00:00:50,019
Let’s explain this with an example.

13
00:00:50,019 --> 00:00:55,620
A good sample of classification is the loan default prediction.

14
00:00:55,620 --> 00:01:00,529
Suppose a bank is concerned about the potential for loans not to be repaid.

15
00:01:00,529 --> 00:01:06,469
If previous loan default data can be used to predict which customers are likely to have

16
00:01:06,469 --> 00:01:12,500
problems repaying loans, these &quot;bad risk&quot; customers can either have their loan application

17
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:16,470
declined or offered alternative products.

18
00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:23,140
The goal of a loan default predictor is to use existing loan default data, which is information

19
00:01:23,140 --> 00:01:30,710
about the customers (such as age, income, education, etc.), to build a classifier, pass

20
00:01:30,710 --> 00:01:37,649
a new customer or potential future defaulter to the model, and then label it (i.e. the

21
00:01:37,649 --> 00:01:45,060
data points) as &quot;Defaulter&quot; or &quot;Not Defaulter&quot;, or for example, 0 or 1.

22
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:49,259
This is how a classifier predicts an unlabeled test case.

23
00:01:49,259 --> 00:01:54,990
Please notice that this specific example was about a binary classifier with two values.

24
00:01:54,990 --> 00:02:03,249
We can also build classifier models for both binary classification and multi-class classification.

25
00:02:03,249 --> 00:02:08,759
For example, imagine that you collected data about a set of patients, all of whom suffered

26
00:02:08,758 --> 00:02:10,429
from the same illness.

27
00:02:10,429 --> 00:02:16,370
During their course of treatment, each patient responded to one of three medications.

28
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:22,960
You can use this labeled dataset, with a classification algorithm, to build a classification model.

29
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:27,820
Then you can use it to find out which drug might be appropriate for a future patient

30
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:29,959
with the same illness.

31
00:02:29,959 --> 00:02:35,780
As you can see, it is a sample of multi-class classification.

32
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:40,010
Classification has different business use cases as well, for example:

33
00:02:40,010 --> 00:02:43,690
To predict the category to which a customer belongs;

34
00:02:43,690 --> 00:02:48,390
For Churn detection, where we predict whether a customer switches to another provider or

35
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:52,540
brand; Or to predict whether or not a customer responds

36
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:56,060
to a particular advertising campaign.

37
00:02:56,060 --> 00:03:00,849
Data classification has several applications in a wide variety of industries.

38
00:03:00,849 --> 00:03:06,480
Essentially, many problems can be expressed as associations between feature and target

39
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:10,690
variables, especially when labeled data is available.

40
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:14,760
This provides a broad range of applicability for classification.

41
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:21,260
For example, classification can be used for email filtering, speech recognition, handwriting

42
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:27,870
recognition, bio-metric identification, document classification, and much more.

43
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:32,060
Here we have the types of classification algorithms in machine learning.

44
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:40,459
They include: Decision Trees, Naïve Bayes, Linear Discriminant Analysis, K-nearest neighbor,

45
00:03:40,459 --> 00:03:45,939
Logistic regression, Neural Networks, and Support Vector Machines.

46
00:03:45,939 --> 00:03:48,290
There are many types of classification algorithms.

47
00:03:48,290 --> 00:03:52,209
We will only cover a few in this course.

48
00:03:52,209 --> 00:03:52,709
Thanks for watching.
