Hello, and welcome! In this video, we’ll give you a high level

1
00:00:05,070 --> 00:00:11,020
introduction to clustering, its applications, and different types of clustering algorithms.

2
00:00:11,020 --> 00:00:13,290
Let’s get started.

3
00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:17,500
Imagine that you have a customer dataset, and you need to apply customer segmentation

4
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:23,220
on this historical data. Customer segmentation is the practice of partitioning

5
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:28,869
a customer base into groups of individuals that have similar characteristics.

6
00:00:28,869 --> 00:00:34,500
It is a significant strategy as it allows a business to target specific groups of customers

7
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:38,620
so as to more effectively allocate marketing resources.

8
00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:44,850
For example, one group might contain customers who are high-profit and low-risk, that is,

9
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:48,660
more likely to purchase products, or subscribe for a service.

10
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:54,329
Knowing this information allows a business to devote more time and attention to retaining

11
00:00:54,329 --> 00:00:58,200
these customers. Another group might include customers from

12
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:04,739
non-profit organizations, and so on. A general segmentation process is not usually

13
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:10,740
feasible for large volumes of varied data. Therefore, you need an analytical approach

14
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:15,270
to deriving segments and groups from large data sets.

15
00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:20,759
Customers can be grouped based on several factors: including age, gender, interests,

16
00:01:20,759 --> 00:01:25,700
spending habits, and so on. The important requirement is to use the available

17
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:30,429
data to understand and identify how customers are similar to each other.

18
00:01:30,429 --> 00:01:35,700
Let’s learn how to divide a set of customers into categories, based on characteristics

19
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:39,329
they share. One of the most adopted approaches that can

20
00:01:39,329 --> 00:01:46,750
be used for customer segmentation is clustering. Clustering can group data only “unsupervised,”

21
00:01:46,750 --> 00:01:50,149
based on the similarity of customers to each other.

22
00:01:50,149 --> 00:01:57,109
It will partition your customers into mutually exclusive groups, for example, into 3 clusters.

23
00:01:57,109 --> 00:02:02,009
The customers in each cluster are similar to each other demographically.

24
00:02:02,009 --> 00:02:06,819
Now we can create a profile for each group, considering the common characteristics of

25
00:02:06,819 --> 00:02:10,929
each cluster. For example, the first group is made up of

26
00:02:10,929 --> 00:02:16,750
AFFULUENT AND MIDDLE AGED customers. The second is made up of YOUNG EDUCATED AND

27
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:21,469
MIDDLE INCOME customers. And the third group includes YOUNG AND LOW

28
00:02:21,469 --> 00:02:26,370
INCOME customers. Finally, we can assign each individual in

29
00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:29,910
our dataset to one of these groups or segments of customers.

30
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:36,190
Now imagine that you cross-join this segmented dataset, with the dataset of the product or

31
00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:39,930
services that customers purchase from your company.

32
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:46,090
This information would really help to understand and predict the differences in individual

33
00:02:46,090 --> 00:02:51,219
customers’ preferences and their buying behaviors across various products.

34
00:02:51,219 --> 00:02:56,240
Indeed, having this information would allow your company to develop highly personalized

35
00:02:56,240 --> 00:03:01,720
experiences for each segment. Customer segmentation is one of the popular

36
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:06,749
usages of clustering. Cluster analysis also has many other applications

37
00:03:06,749 --> 00:03:11,410
in different domains. So let’s first define clustering, and then

38
00:03:11,410 --> 00:03:14,620
we’ll look at other applications.

39
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:18,890
Clustering means finding clusters in a dataset, unsupervised.

40
00:03:18,890 --> 00:03:24,739
So, what is a cluster? A cluster is group of data points or objects

41
00:03:24,739 --> 00:03:30,930
in a dataset that are similar to other objects in the group, and dissimilar to data points

42
00:03:30,930 --> 00:03:35,709
in other clusters. Now, the question is, “What is different

43
00:03:35,709 --> 00:03:38,889
between clustering and classification?”

44
00:03:38,889 --> 00:03:45,120
Let’s look at our customer dataset again. Classification algorithms predict categorical

45
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:50,150
class labels. This means, assigning instances to pre-defined

46
00:03:50,150 --> 00:03:57,629
classes such as “Defaulted” or “Non-Defaulted.” For example, if an analyst wants to analyze

47
00:03:57,629 --> 00:04:03,650
customer data in order to know which customers might default on their payments, she uses

48
00:04:03,650 --> 00:04:10,390
a labeled dataset as training data, and uses classification approaches such as a decision

49
00:04:10,390 --> 00:04:17,919
tree, Support Vector Machines (or SVM), or, logistic regression to predict the default

50
00:04:17,919 --> 00:04:25,349
value for a new, or unknown customer. Generally speaking, classification is a supervised

51
00:04:25,349 --> 00:04:30,810
learning where each training data instance belongs to a particular class.

52
00:04:30,810 --> 00:04:37,270
In clustering, however, the data is unlabelled and the process is unsupervised.

53
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:43,380
For example, we can use a clustering algorithm such as k-Means, to group similar customers

54
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:49,599
as mentioned, and assign them to a cluster, based on whether they share similar attributes,

55
00:04:49,599 --> 00:04:54,569
such as age, education, and so on. While I’ll be giving you some examples in

56
00:04:54,569 --> 00:04:59,900
different industries, I’d like you to think about more samples of clustering.

57
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:05,259
In the Retail industry, clustering is used to find associations among customers based

58
00:05:05,259 --> 00:05:10,830
on their demographic characteristics and use that information to identify buying patterns

59
00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:16,460
of various customer groups. Also, it can be used in recommendation systems

60
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:22,270
to find a group of similar items or similar users, and use it for collaborative filtering,

61
00:05:22,270 --> 00:05:26,750
to recommend things like books or movies to customers.

62
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:32,810
In Banking, analysts find clusters of normal transactions to find the patterns of fraudulent

63
00:05:32,810 --> 00:05:37,840
credit card usage. Also, they use clustering to identify clusters

64
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:42,900
of customers, for instance, to find loyal customers, versus churn customers.

65
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:50,261
In the Insurance industry, clustering is used for fraud detection in claims analysis, or

66
00:05:50,261 --> 00:05:56,159
to evaluate the insurance risk of certain customers based on their segments.

67
00:05:56,159 --> 00:06:02,650
In Publication Media, clustering is used to auto-categorize news based on its content,

68
00:06:02,650 --> 00:06:09,599
or to tag news, then cluster it, so as to recommend similar news articles to readers.

69
00:06:09,599 --> 00:06:16,400
In Medicine: it can be used to characterize patient behavior, based on their similar characteristics,

70
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:20,700
so as to identify successful medical therapies for different illnesses.

71
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:27,371
Or, in Biology: clustering is used to group genes with similar expression patterns, or

72
00:06:27,371 --> 00:06:32,460
to cluster genetic markers to identify family ties.

73
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:38,090
If you look around, you can find many other applications of clustering, but generally,

74
00:06:38,090 --> 00:06:44,180
clustering can be used for one of the following purposes: exploratory data analysis, summary

75
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:50,509
generation or reducing the scale, outlier detection, especially to be used for fraud

76
00:06:50,509 --> 00:06:57,810
detection, or noise removal, finding duplicates in datasets, or, as a pre-processing step

77
00:06:57,810 --> 00:07:03,930
for either prediction, other data mining tasks, or, as part of a complex system.

78
00:07:03,930 --> 00:07:10,009
Let’s briefly look at different clustering algorithms and their characteristics.

79
00:07:10,009 --> 00:07:14,840
Partitioned-based clustering is a group of clustering algorithms that produces sphere-like

80
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:21,340
clusters, such as k-Means, k-Median, or Fuzzy c-Means.

81
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:27,789
These algorithms are relatively efficient and are used for Medium and Large sized databases.

82
00:07:27,789 --> 00:07:33,190
Hierarchical clustering algorithms produce trees of clusters, such as Agglomerative and

83
00:07:33,190 --> 00:07:38,199
Divisive algorithms. This group of algorithms are very intuitive

84
00:07:38,199 --> 00:07:42,120
and are generally good for use with small size datasets.

85
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:47,540
Density based clustering algorithms produce arbitrary shaped clusters.

86
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:53,060
They are especially good when dealing with spatial clusters or when there is noise in

87
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:58,289
your dataset, for example, the DBSCAN algorithm.

88
00:07:58,289 --> 00:08:00,930
This concludes our video. Thanks for watching!
