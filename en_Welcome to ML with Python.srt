Hello, and welcome to Machine Learning with Python.

1
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:10,839
In this course, you’ll learn how Machine Learning is used in many key fields and industries.

2
00:00:10,839 --> 00:00:16,590
For example, in the health care industry, data scientists use Machine Learning to predict

3
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:21,990
whether a human cell that is believed to be at risk of developing cancer, is either benign

4
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:23,169
or malignant.

5
00:00:23,169 --> 00:00:29,910
As such, Machine learning can play a key role in determining a person’s health and welfare.

6
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:36,031
You’ll also learn about the value of decision trees and how building a good decision tree

7
00:00:36,031 --> 00:00:43,180
from historical data helps doctors to prescribe the proper medicine for each of their patients.

8
00:00:43,180 --> 00:00:49,100
You’ll learn how bankers use machine learning to make decisions on whether to approve loan

9
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:51,370
applications.

10
00:00:51,370 --> 00:00:56,460
And you will learn how to use machine learning to do bank customer segmentation, where it

11
00:00:56,460 --> 00:01:02,580
is not usually easy to run for huge volumes of varied data.

12
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:08,550
In this course, you’ll see how machine learning helps websites such as YouTube, Amazon, or

13
00:01:08,550 --> 00:01:15,360
Netflix develop recommendations to their customers about various products or services, such as

14
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:20,830
which movies they might be interested in going to see or which books to buy.

15
00:01:20,830 --> 00:01:24,490
There is so much that you can do with Machine Learning!

16
00:01:24,490 --> 00:01:30,300
Here, you’ll learn how to use popular python libraries to build your model.

17
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:35,882
For example, given an automobile dataset, we use the sci-kit learn (sklearn) library

18
00:01:35,882 --> 00:01:42,690
to estimate the Co2 emission of cars using their Engine size or Cylinders.

19
00:01:42,690 --> 00:01:47,130
We can even predict what the Co2 emissions will be for a car that hasn’t even been

20
00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:49,420
produced yet!

21
00:01:49,420 --> 00:01:54,979
And we’ll see how the telecommunications industry can predict customer churn.

22
00:01:54,979 --> 00:02:00,659
You can run and practice the code of all these samples using the built-in lab environment

23
00:02:00,659 --> 00:02:01,800
in this course.

24
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:08,130
You don’t have to install anything to your computer or do anything on the cloud.

25
00:02:08,130 --> 00:02:13,629
All you have to do is click a button to start the lab environment in your browser.

26
00:02:13,629 --> 00:02:20,209
The code for the samples is already written using python language, in Jupyter notebooks,

27
00:02:20,209 --> 00:02:26,489
and you can run it to see the results, or change it to understand the algorithms better.

28
00:02:26,489 --> 00:02:31,169
So, what will you be able to achieve by taking this course?

29
00:02:31,169 --> 00:02:36,849
Well, by putting in just a few hours a week over the next few weeks, you’ll get new

30
00:02:36,849 --> 00:02:44,579
skills to add to your resume, such as regression, classification, clustering, sci-kit learn

31
00:02:44,579 --> 00:02:46,139
and SciPy.

32
00:02:46,139 --> 00:02:53,079
You’ll also get new projects that you can add to your portfolio, including cancer detection,

33
00:02:53,079 --> 00:03:00,060
predicting economic trends, predicting customer churn, recommendation engines, and many more.

34
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:06,290
You’ll also get a certificate in machine learning to prove your competency, and share

35
00:03:06,290 --> 00:03:13,540
it anywhere you like online or offline, such as LinkedIn profiles and social media.

36
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:14,480
So let’s get started.
